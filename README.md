# Analog-Clock
This project features a visually appealing analog clock that displays the current time in real-time. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website offers a clean and minimalist design for easy viewing. Upon loading, the clock accurately reflects the local time with smooth, dynamic movements of the hour, minute, and second hands.
